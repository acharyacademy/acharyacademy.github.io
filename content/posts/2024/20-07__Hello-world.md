For centuries education has been a building block for any nation, but along the way we have lost the true essence of learning.One of my favorite activity with my dad was to discuss, debate about topics during our travel. And to this day, I remember those topics.
I always wondered why can't our classrooms and teachers be like that, I blamed everyone but at the end I chose to just shut up and do my own thing. I believed maybe it's just me and not everyone may like this way of teaching.

## The idea

Long-term keyword: Insights into the education system

The idea came to me when I was teaching a class of students as substitute for my friend. I taught them the way I learnt them with using stories, building narratives around the stories, asking students to build imaginations around abstract topics, even though it was tough and time-taking but I loved teaching that way.
This made me realise I actually love teaching but not the way textbooks are supposed to teach everyone. So just to test the waters, I started tutoring 3 students, and from their reviews and performance I felt confident about my teaching methods.

Soon after I rented out a place, with proper setup and facilities. And to my surprise, students loved this way of learning. According to them, this doesn't feel like studying instead they think of it as some fun activity. Within a year we had to rent a bigger place.

## The conclusion

Long-term keyword: The vision

At Acharya, we strongly believe that learning should never be a daunting task, we should teach them to be curious and problem solver, so they go out themselves and learn to ask questions and also find a solution. 
At Acharya, we aim to help students by making learning more accessible to everyone.
